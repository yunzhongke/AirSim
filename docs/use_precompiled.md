# Coming Soon
Unreal Environments are highly detailed and generates very large files. We are still trying to figure out the best strategy to host these big binaries. 

If you would like to contribute or have any suggestions, [let us know](https://github.com/Microsoft/AirSim/issues). 
Please include these [log files](logging.md) when you report an issue.

We *might* be able to make binaries available through private channels as a one-off item to select individuals. Due to licensing 
restrictions, we cannot make some of our environments available as source code.
